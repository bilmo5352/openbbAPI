# Technical analysis
# No GitHub-only dependencies during deploy (some platforms block git clone).
# We compute indicators in pure pandas/numpy as a fallback.

# OpenBB Platform (optional but recommended)
# OpenBB is optional but pulls pandas-ta beta which isn't available on PyPI and
# often requires GitHub access. Keep it out of the deploy image.
