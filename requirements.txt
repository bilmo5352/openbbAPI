# Technical analysis
# No GitHub-only dependencies during deploy (some platforms block git clone).
# We compute indicators in pure pandas/numpy as a fallback.

# pandas-ta (Pandas Technical Analysis) - 200+ indicators (OPTIONAL)
# It currently causes heavy dependency backtracking with Python 3.12 on Windows.
# Leave it commented out by default and install manually if needed:
#   pip install pandas-ta
# pandas-ta

# TA-Lib (Technical Analysis Library) - ~150 indicators
# NOTE: TA-Lib requires the C library to be installed first!
# Windows: Download from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#ta-lib
#          Then: pip install TA_Lib-0.4.XX-cpXX-cpXX-win_amd64.whl
# Linux:   sudo apt-get install ta-lib (or equivalent)
#          Then: pip install TA-Lib
# macOS:   brew install ta-lib
#          Then: pip install TA-Lib
# If TA-Lib is not installed, the system will gracefully fall back to other libraries.
# TA-Lib

# OpenBB Platform (optional but recommended)
# OpenBB is optional but pulls pandas-ta beta which isn't available on PyPI and
# often requires GitHub access. Keep it out of the deploy image.
# Install via: pip install openbb[technical]
# openbb[technical]

# Environment variables
python-dotenv==1.0.0

# Utilities
requests==2.31.0
