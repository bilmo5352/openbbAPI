# Data processing
# NOTE: We do NOT pin pandas/numpy here. They are pulled in by pandas-ta with
# compatible versions for Python 3.12 on Linux. Pinning them caused pip to
# try to build incompatible pandas from source (the Meson error you saw).

# Data sources
kiteconnect==4.1.0
yfinance==0.2.32

# Technical analysis
# In Docker (Python 3.12 on Linux), pandas-ta installs cleanly and pulls
# suitable pandas/numpy versions, giving you 100+ indicators.
pandas-ta

# TA-Lib and OpenBB are optional and intentionally not included in the base
# Docker image to keep the build simple and portable. The API will still
# expose all manual + pandas-ta indicators (~113 in your current setup).

# Environment variables
python-dotenv==1.0.0

# Utilities
